# TensorBoard-Keras-GoogleColab

  TensorBoard is a browser-based visualisation tool used to view live training of models as well as graphs of several other parameters. It comes packaged with TensorFlow and can be used with Keras with TensorFlow backend.
  
  TensorBoard is easy enough to run on a local machine, however the same method didn't seem to be working on Google Colab. This is the most reliable method I found of using TensorBoard on Colab.
  
  TensorBoard Implementation of MNIST Dataset is done in **MNIST_tbcolab.ipynb**. I've also included:
    
    a) The Graphs and Visualisations in the folder 'visuals'
    b) The Data and Log Files in the folder 'data'
  
  This repository is inspired from the following article: https://medium.com/@tommytao_54597/use-tensorboard-in-google-colab-16b4bb9812a6
  
  The files are created in Google Colab. Link is included.
  
  Comments and Suggestions are welcome :)
